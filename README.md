### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
Here lies the pile of code made by **itsmevjnk**, a computer science student who's currently into low level/embedded and app development.
Here's some fun (or is it?) facts about me:
 - ğŸ‡»ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡º Vietnamese student in Australia! (Melbourne is pretty nice actually, or is it? Still got like 3 years to find that out...)
 - ğŸ”­ I'm currently working on **[HRng](https://github.com/itsmevjnk/HRng.git)** and smaller projects that I don't publish anywhere
 - ğŸŒ± I'm learning **web scraping**, **C#** and (maybe) **ReactJS** (just maybe, I should really get started with that one day ğŸ¤”). I'd also like to learn physics simulation one day too :^)
 - ğŸ“« You can reach me via my personal email ([ngtv0404@gmail.com](mailto:ngtv0404@gmail.com)), or if you so prefer, my school email ([s223145883@deakin.edu.au](mailto:s223145883@deakin.edu.au)) (and yes, that's a very, very long address)
 - ğŸ˜„ My pronouns are **he/him**, but to be honest I wouldn't mind if you call me by any other pronouns, it's just that it doesn't matter to me lul.
