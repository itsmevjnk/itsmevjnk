### Hi there 👋
Here lies the pile of code made by **itsmevjnk**, a high school student who's currently into low level/embedded and app development.
Here's some fun (or is it?) facts about me:
 - 🔭 I'm currently working on **[HRng](https://github.com/itsmevjnk/HRng.git)** and smaller projects that I don't publish anywhere
 - 🌱 I'm learning **web scraping**, **C#** and (maybe) **ReactJS** (just maybe, I should really get started with that one day 🤔). I'd also like to learn physics simulation one day too :^)
 - 📫 You can reach me via my personal email ([ngtv0404@gmail.com](mailto:ngtv0404@gmail.com)), or if you so prefer, my school email ([113ly.vinh.nguyenthanh@c3chuvanan.edu.vn](mailto:113ly.vinh.nguyenthanh@c3chuvanan.edu.vn)) (and yes, that's a very, very long address)
 - 🌐 My (still under construction) website is [itsmevjnk.tech](https://itsmevjnk.tech), feel free to visit (and be greeted with a **403 Forbidden**)
 - 😄 My pronouns are **he/him**, but to be honest I wouldn't mind if you call me by any other pronouns, it's just that it doesn't matter to me lul.
